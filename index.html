                GradKeys was founded by five current college students and recent
                high school graduates from Taiwan. Having recently gone through
                the admissions process ourselves, we understand current trends
                and the realities students face.
              </p>
              <p>
                We stay closely connected with admissions counselors at our
                universities through regular emails, campus visits, and
                conversations to remain informed on evolving international
                admissions standards and common application pitfalls.
              </p>
              <p>
                We put our confidence in you and our service into action by
                structuring our advising packages around promises. We will
                guarantee certain outcomes, determined through mutual
                discussion, and provide a refund if those outcomes are not met.

                Universities begin evaluating grades and activities from 9th
                grade, but meaningful preparation often starts earlier.
                Establishing direction in academics and extracurricular
                involvement early allows students to build a stronger, more
                cohesive profile over time. We recommend beginning as early as
                junior high or before 11th grade to maximize opportunities and
                strategy.
              </p>
              <p>
                That said, every student’s situation is different. We offer
                complimentary consultation sessions for students and parents to
                assess current preparation and determine the right timing and
                level of support.

                Absolutely. While our Everything Package includes 8 schools (2
                safety, 4 target, 2 reach), we understand that each student’s
                needs and strategy may differ. In fact, all five of our founders
                applied to more than eight universities! We recognize that

                Unlimited counseling means you may request meetings at any time
                through our scheduling calendar, with at least three days’
                advance notice. In addition to one required meeting with the
                student and parents, sessions can be scheduled as needed
                throughout your package period.
